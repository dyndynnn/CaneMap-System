### Supabase Tables Used

#### Fields Table

```javascript
{
  id: "uuid",
  field_name: "string",
  barangay: "string", 
  municipality: "string",
  area_size: "number",
  owner_id: "uuid", // Supabase Auth UID of field owner
  crop_variety: "string", // optional
  status: "active" | "sra_reviewed" | "inactive",
  latitude: "number", // optional
  longitude: "number", // optional
  created_at: "timestamp"
}
```

#### Field Workers Table

```javascript
{
  id: "uuid",
  field_id: "uuid", // Reference to fields table
  user_id: "uuid", // Supabase Auth UID
  status: "pending" | "approved" | "rejected",
  requested_at: "timestamp"
}
```

### Features

#### Available Fields

* Displays all fields with status 'active' or 'sra_reviewed'
* Excludes fields owned by the current user
* Shows field details: name, location, area, owner, crop variety
* Allows users to submit join requests

#### Join Requests

* Prevents duplicate requests for the same field
* Shows pending, approved, and rejected requests
* Displays request date and status
